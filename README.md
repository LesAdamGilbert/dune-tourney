## Tournament Flow:
1) Group Stage: Players will play through 3 games with randomly selected opponents. Players are assigned points based on their performance in each game. Points are assigned as follows:

### 4 Player Game
| Place | Points |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1st  | 3 |
| 2nd  | 2 |
| 3rd  | 1 |
| 4th  | 0 |

### 3 Player Game
| Place | Points |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1st  | 3 |
| 2nd  | 1 |
| 3rd  | 0 |

At the end of the game, record leftover spice, solari and water on the given worksheet. They will be used for tie breakers in that order.

2) Once all group stage games have been played, players will be ranked via their score and any tie breakers. The top 4 players will advance to the championship table. The remaining players will be placed at tables in the order of their scores.
3) Prizes will be awarded to the winner of the championship table (top 1-4) and top 5-8 table. First place at the championship table will get a trophy. Everyone else at the championship table will get a medal. The championship table can also choose a prize from the prize pool in order of their final match ranking in addition to their trophy/medals. The winner of the top 5-8 table will get the last prize from the prize pool.	
4) Players who are late to their game receive a -2 points immediatly. After 20 minutes, players who are not present forfeit the round and still receive the -2 points. The round will then start under the 3 player rules.

## Game Rules

2) Seating order and first player will be determined randomly when the matches are generated.
3) The leader pile will be shuffled, and 10 leaders will be put in a pile.
4) The player who is last in turn will choose their leader from the pile first, continuing backward to the first player, who chooses their leader last. All other leaders are discarded and the game will start.
5) 4 Player games start at zero points and play to 10, while 3 player games start at zero points and play to 11.

### Rules To Remember:
- Intrigue Card valid play rules will be enforced. Be familiar when plot, combat and endgame cards can be played.
- Family atomics will only shuffle the Imperium Row and not the Tleilaxu Row. Family Atomics can only be played on the player’s agent turn or during a reveal phase.
- Agents must be placed and the board space costs must be paid before any card actions can be resolved. Example: When going to a board space that costs water, the player needs to pay the water cost first before the card is resolved. The player cannot use the water gained from the card to pay the cost. Intrigue cards can be played before an agent action.

## House Rules
- Banned Cards: Tleilaxu Master, Ghola
- Turns are not timed, but it is recommended that each turn not take longer than an average of 2 minutes each. If a player is taking too long, and all 3 opponents agree, a timer will be placed and turns for the offending player will be timed to 2 minutes throughout the rest of the game.
- When a player finishes their turn, they must verbally tell the next player that their turn is complete before the next player can start.
  - Once you pass the turn to the next player, you cannot undo anything from your turn without all three players at the table agreeing. One veto means the action cannot be undone.
  - Once the next player has taken any action, requests for redos turns cannot be requested.
  - Mandatory effects can be played late, and the table will agree how to fairly resolve them or if resolving it would be too unfair and must be skipped.
-   Card effects/resources/leader abilities are the player’s responsibility to manage and should be played on that player’s turn. If things are forgotten, opponents can veto via the rules described above.
-   On your turn, some actions cannot be undone once taken. This normally involves when a player gains information. Example: drawing a card or intrigue card because the player has received information could fake a mistake due to bad luck.
